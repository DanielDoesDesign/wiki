# Proper way to use an LED

## A led is short for a Light Emitting ***Diode***

Diodes are devices that let electricity flow only in one direction. LEDs work the same way as they are a diode also.  

When you connect an led to a circuit you have a direct link from one leg of the diode, to the other.  LEDs can not process large amounts of current, they are limited to 20ma or less. Although they will try and pass the full current, doing so will cause the LED to burn out, or it will shorten the life of the led.  To stop this from happening we use a resistor and this limits the amount of current flowing through the led enough that it lights, but does not burn out.

# Wireing
## Correct

It does not matter for a single LED wether you apply the resistor to the GND, or thepower side.  So this is how you would wire a standard LED.
